\subsubsection*{Skeleta of categories}
 A category is called \textbf{reduced} if isomorphic objects are identical. A subcategory $\mathcal{S}$ of a category $\mathcal{C}$ is a \textbf{skeleton} if $\mathcal{S}$ is reduced and if the inclusion $\mathcal{S} \hookrightarrow \mathcal{C}$ is an equivalence of categories.
\begin{example}
    
    \begin{enumerate}
        
        \item Consider the category of finite sets and functions. It contains the full subcategory whose objects are the sets of the form $\{1, \ldots, n\}$ for $n \geq 0$. Here, we use the convention that the empty set is encoded by $n=0$. The inclusion functor is full and faithful. As every finite set is in bijection with a standardized set of the form $\{1, \ldots, n\}$ as above, the inclusion functor is also essentially surjective. Therefore, these finite sets build a skeleton.
        
        \item A similar example is the category of finite-dimensional $K$-vector spaces. This has as a skeleton the full subcategory of vector spaces of the form $K^n$ for some finite natural number $n$. Here, $n=0$ encodes the zero vector space.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{example}

\begin{prop}
    Every category has an skeleton
\end{prop}



\item Let $\mathcal{C}=$ Fin be a small skeleton of the category of finite sets, let $\mathcal{D}$ be the category of sets, Sets, and let $I$ be the canonical inclusion functor of the subcategory Fin into the category Sets. If $\mathcal{E}$ is an arbitrary cocomplete category, then Theorem 4.1.4 ensures, that you can extend any functor $F$ : Fin $\rightarrow \mathcal{E}$ as a left Kan extension to the category Sets, and you actually have an explicit formula for doing it.
