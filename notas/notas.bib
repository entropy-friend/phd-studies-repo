  abstract = {The recent proof by Madsen and Weiss of Mumford’s conjecture on the stable cohomology of moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces, was a dramatic example of an important stability theorem about the topology of moduli spaces. In this article we give a survey of families of classifying spaces and moduli spaces where “stability phenomena” occur in their topologies. Such stability theorems have been proved in many situations in the history of topology and geometry, and the payoff has often been quite remarkable. In this paper we discuss classical stability theorems such as the Freudenthal suspension theorem, Bott periodicity, and Whitney’s embedding theorems. We then discuss more modern examples such as those involving configuration spaces of points in manifolds, holomorphic curves in complex manifolds, gauge theoretic moduli spaces, the stable topology of general linear groups, and pseudoisotopies of manifolds. We then discuss the stability theorems regarding the moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces: Harer’s stability theorem on the cohomology of moduli space, and the Madsen-Weiss theorem, which proves a generalization of Mumford’s conjecture. We also describe Galatius’s recent theorem on the stable cohomology of automorphisms of free groups. We end by speculating on the existence of general conditions in which one might expect these stability phenomena to occur.},

We show its relation to discrete Morse theory. As application we give an alternative proof of Webb's conjecture for saturated fusion systems and we compute the cohomology of Coxeter complexes for finite and infinite Coxeter groups.},

The ideas are first illustrated by reproving the Nakaoka stability theorem on homology stability for symmetric groups.},

The symplectic groups \$\textbackslash operatorname\{Sp\}\_n(R)\$ and orthogonal groups \$\textbackslash mathrm\{O\}\_\{2 n\}(R)\$ (of Witt index \$n\$ ) are considered. Applying Quillen's plus-construction to these groups, one can define symplectic and orthogonal K-theories. On the other hand, one can use Borel subgroups to define Volodin type K-theories. Nemytov and Solov'ev sketched a proof that these two approaches result in the same Kgroups. The present paper gives a more detailed exposition. The result is useful for stability problems in symplectic and orthogonal Ktheories. Thus, the paper extends Suslin's stability results for general linear groups to orthogonal and symplectic groups over commutative rings. The results are the best possible for the rings R of algebraic integers in number fields. In particular, the groups \$\textbackslash mathrm\{H\}\_\{\textbackslash mathrm\{i\}\}\textbackslash left(\textbackslash mathrm\{O\}\_\{2 \textbackslash mathrm\{n\}\}(\textbackslash mathrm\{R\})\textbackslash right.\$ ) and \$\textbackslash mathrm\{H\}\_\{\textbackslash mathrm\{i\}\}\textbackslash left(\textbackslash mathrm\{Sp\}\_\{2 \textbackslash mathrm\{n\}\}(\textbackslash mathrm\{R\})\textbackslash right)\$ are independent of n for such R when \$\textbackslash mathrm\{n\} \textbackslash geq 2 \textbackslash mathrm\{i\}+1 \textbackslash geq 5\$.},

  abstract = {Homological stability has shown itself to be a powerful tool for the computation of homology of families of groups such as general linear groups, mapping class groups or automorphisms of free groups. We survey here tools and techniques for proving homological stability theorems and for computing the stable homology, and illustrate the method through the computation of the homology of Higman-Thompson groups.},

  abstract = {The landscape of homological algebra has evolved over the last half-century into a fundamental tool for the working mathematician. This book provides a unified account of homological algebra as it exists today. The historical connection with topology, regular local rings, and semi-simple Lie algebras are also described. This book is suitable for second or third year graduate students. The first half of the book takes as its subject the canonical topics in homological algebra: derived functors, Tor and Ext, projective dimensions and spectral sequences. Homology of group and Lie algebras illustrate these topics.  Intermingled are less canonical topics, such as the derived inverse limit functor lim1, local cohomology, Galois cohomology, and affine Lie algebras. The last part of the book covers less traditional topics that are a vital part of the modern homological toolkit: simplicial methods, Hochschild and cyclic homology, derived categories and total derived functors. By making these tools more accessible, the book helps to break down the technological barrier between experts and casual users of homological algebra.},

We describe a modified version of H. Maazen's work [18], yielding stability for the homology of linear groups overR. Applying W.G. Dwyer's arguments (cf. [9]) we also get stability for homology with twisted coefficients. For example,H2(GLn(R), R n ) takes on a stable value whenn becomes large.},
