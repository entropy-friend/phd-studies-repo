Simplicial complexes are more intuitive, and are the foundation of algebraic topology. $\Delta$-complexes are usueful for computations. Simplicial sets are more suitable to high level concepts.

\section{(Abstract) simplical complexes}

A set (of \textbf{vertices}) together with a  family of finite subsets (\textbf{simplexes}) such that every subset of every simplex is a simplex and every subset consisting of a single vertex is a simplex.  

\begin{example}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The \textbf{standard n-simplex} $\Delta^n$ is the set of all $(n+1)$-tuples $(t_0, \ldots, t_n)$ of non-negative real numbers such that $t_0 + \cdots + t_n = 1$. The standard 0-simplex is a point, the standard 1-simplex is a line segment, the standard 2-simplex is a triangle, and so on.

        \item The \textbf{boundary} of the standard n-simplex $\Delta^n$ is the set of all $(n+1)$-tuples $(t_0, \ldots, t_n)$ of non-negative real numbers such that $t_0 + \cdots + t_n = 1$ and at least one of the $t_i$ is zero. The boundary of the standard 0-simplex is empty, the boundary of the standard 1-simplex is the set of its two endpoints, the boundary of the standard 2-simplex is the set of its three edges, and so on.

        \item (\textbf{Concrete simplicial complexes}) It is subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$ that is a union of standard simplices, that satisfies the previous conditions.

        \item If Y is a subset of the vertex set of a simplicial scheme $S$, then we can introduce on it the induced simplicial scheme structure $ Y \cap S$, by defining the simplexes as the subsets of $ Y $ that are simplexes of $S$.  

        \item Let $X$ be a set and let $\{p(y): y \in Y\}$ be a covering of $X$. Then we can consider two simplicial complexes. 
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item The nerve $\operatorname{Nerv}(p)$ of the covering is the simplicial scheme with the vertex set $Y$, and a subset $Z$ of $Y$ is counted as a simplex if the intersection $\underset{Z}{\cap} p(y)$ is non-empty. 
            \item The simplicial complex $V(p)$ is the simplicial scheme with the vertex set $X$, and a subset $Z$ of $X$ is counted as a simplex if $Z$ is contained in some $p(y)$.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}
\end{example}

\subsection*{Geometric realization}

The construction goes as follows. First, define $|K|$ as a subset of $[0,1]^S$ consisting of functions $t: S \rightarrow[0,1]$ satisfying the two conditions: $\square$
$$
\begin{aligned}
& \left\{s \in S: t_s>0\right\} \in K \\
& \sum_{s \in S} t_s=1
\end{aligned}
$$

Now think of the set of elements of $[0,1]^S$ with finite support as the direct limit of $[0,1]^A$ where $A$ ranges over finite subsets of $S$, and give that direct limit the induced topology. Now give $|K|$ the subspace topology. \textit{It is always Hausdorff}. We will identify an abstract simplicial complex with its geometric realization.



\section{CW-complexes}

They can be defined in an inductive way:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Start with a discrete set $X^0$, whose points are regarded as 0 -cells.
    \item Inductively, form the $\boldsymbol{n}$-skeleton $X^n$ from $X^{n-1}$ by attaching $n$-cells $e_\alpha^n$ via maps $\varphi_\alpha: S^{n-1} \rightarrow X^{n-1}$. This means that $X^n$ is the quotient space of the disjoint union $X^{n-1} \amalg_\alpha D_\alpha^n$ of $X^{n-1}$ with a collection of $n$-disks $D_\alpha^n$ under the identifications $x \sim \varphi_\alpha(x)$ for $x \in \partial D_\alpha^n$. Thus as a set, $X^n=X^{n-1} \amalg_\alpha e_\alpha^n$ where each $e_\alpha^n$ is an open $n$-disk.
    \item One can either stop this inductive process at a finite stage, setting $X=X^n$ for some $n<\infty$, or one can continue indefinitely, setting $X=\cup_n X^n$. In the latter case $X$ is given the weak topology: A set $A \subset X$ is open (or closed) iff $A \cap X^n$ is open (or closed) in $X^n$ for each $n$.
    
\end{enumerate}

\begin{example}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item A 1-dimensional cell complex $X=X^1$ is what is called a graph in algebraic topology. It consists of vertices (the 0 -cells) to which edges (the 1-cells) are attached. The two ends of an edge can be attached to the same vertex.
        \item The sphere $S^n$ has the structure of a cell complex with just two cells, $e^0$ and $e^n$, the $n$-cell being attached by the constant map $S^{n-1} \rightarrow e^0$. This is equivalent to regarding $S^n$ as the quotient space $D^n / \partial D^n$.
        \item \textbf{Real projective $\boldsymbol{n}$-space $\mathbb{R} \mathrm{P}^n$.} It is equivalent to the quotient space of a hemisphere $D^n$ with antipodal points of $\partial D^n$ identified. Since $\partial D^n$ with antipodal points identified is just $\mathbb{R P} \mathrm{P}^{n-1}$, we see that $\mathbb{R} \mathrm{P}^n$ is obtained from $\mathbb{R} \mathrm{P}^{n-1}$ by attaching an $n$-cell, with the quotient projection $S^{n-1} \rightarrow \mathbb{R} P^{n-1}$ as the attaching map. It follows by induction on $n$ that $\mathbb{R P}^n$ has a cell complex structure $e^0 \cup e^1 \cup \cdots \cup e^n$ with one cell $e^i$ in each dimension $i \leq n$.\\
        The infinite union $\mathbb{R} P^{\infty}=U_n \mathbb{R} P^n$ becomes a cell complex with one cell in each dimension. We can view $\mathbb{R} P^{\infty}$ as the space of lines through the origin in $\mathbb{R}^{\infty}=\bigcup_n \mathbb{R}^n$.
        
        \item \textbf{Complex projective space $\mathbb{C} P^n$.} It is equivalent to the quotient of the unit sphere $S^{2 n+1} \subset \mathbb{C}^{n+1}$ with $v \sim \lambda v$ for $|\lambda|=1$. \\
        It is also possible to obtain $\mathbb{C P}^n$ as a quotient space of the disk $D^{2 n}$ under the identifications $v \sim \lambda v$ for $v \in \partial D^{2 n}$, in the following way. The vectors in $S^{2 n+1} \subset \mathbb{C}^{n+1}$ with last coordinate real and nonnegative are precisely the vectors of the form $\left(w, \sqrt{1-|w|^2}\right) \in \mathbb{C}^n \times \mathbb{C}$ with $|w| \leq 1$. Such vectors form the graph of the function $w \mapsto \sqrt{1-|w|^2}$. This is a disk $D_{+}^{2 n}$ bounded by the sphere $S^{2 n-1} \subset S^{2 n+1}$ consisting of vectors $(w, 0) \in \mathbb{C}^n \times \mathbb{C}$ with $|w|=1$. Each vector in $S^{2 n+1}$ is equivalent under the identifications $v \sim \lambda v$ to a vector in $D_{+}^{2 n}$, and the latter vector is unique if its last coordinate is nonzero. If the last coordinate is zero, we have just the identifications $v \sim \lambda v$ for $v \in S^{2 n-1}$.\\
        It follows that $\mathbb{P}^n$ is obtained from $\mathbb{C} \mathrm{P}^{n-1}$ by attaching a cell $e^{2 n}$ via the quotient map $S^{2 n-1} \rightarrow \mathbb{C P}^{n-1}$. So by induction on $n$ we obtain a cell structure $\mathbb{C P}^n=e^0 \cup e^2 \cup \cdots \cup e^{2 n}$ with cells only in even dimensions. Similarly, $\mathbb{C P}^{\infty}$ has a cell structure with one cell in each even dimension.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{example}

Each cell $e_\alpha^n$ in a cell complex $X$ has a \textbf{characteristic map} $\Phi_\alpha: D_\alpha^n \rightarrow X$ which extends the attaching map $\varphi_\alpha$ and is a homeomorphism from the interior of $D_\alpha^n$ onto $e_\alpha^n$. Namely, we can take $\Phi_\alpha$ to be the composition $D_\alpha^n \hookrightarrow X^{n-1} \coprod_\alpha D_\alpha^n \rightarrow X^n \hookrightarrow X$ where the middle map is the quotient map defining $X^n$. 





\section{Simplical sets}

Let $\mathbf{\Delta}$ be the category of finite ordinal numbers, with order-preserving maps between them. More precisely, the objects for $\Delta$ consist of elements $\mathbf{n}, n \geq 0$, where $\mathbf{n}$ is a string of relations
$$
0 \rightarrow 1 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow \cdots \rightarrow n
$$
(in other words $\mathbf{n}$ is a totally ordered set with $n+1$ elements). A morphism $\theta: \mathbf{m} \rightarrow \mathbf{n}$ is an order-preserving set function, or alternatively a functor. We usually commit the abuse of saying that $\mathbf{\Delta}$ is the ordinal number category.

A simplicial set is a contravariant functor $X: \Delta^{o p} \rightarrow$ Sets, where Sets is the category of sets.

\begin{rema}
    The standard covariant functor: $\mathbf{n} \mapsto |\Delta^n| $ from $\Delta$ to \textbf{Top}. The singular set $S(T)$ is the simplicial set given by
    $$
    \mathbf{n} \mapsto \operatorname{hom}\left(\left|\Delta^n\right|, T\right) .
    $$
    
    This is the object that gives the singular homology of the space $T$.\\

    The standard $n$-simplex, simplicial $\Delta^n$ in the simplicial set category $\mathbf{S}$ is defined by
$$
\Delta^n=\operatorname{hom}_{\Delta}(, \mathbf{n}) .
$$

In other words, $\Delta^n$ is the contravariant functor on $\Delta$ which is represented by n.
\end{rema}

A map $f: X \rightarrow Y$ of simplicial sets (or, more simply, a simplicial map) is a natural transformation of contravariant set-valued functors defined on $\boldsymbol{\Delta}$. We shall use $\mathbf{S}$ to denote the resulting category of simplicial sets and simplicial maps.\\

From a simplicial set $Y$, one may construct a simplicial abelian group $\mathbb{Z} Y$ (ie. a contravariant functor $\boldsymbol{\Delta}^{o p} \rightarrow \mathbf{A b}$ ), with $\mathbb{Z} Y_n$ set equal to the free abelian group on $Y_n$. The simplicial abelian group $\mathbb{Z} Y$ has associated to it a chain complex, called its Moore complex and also written $\mathbb{Z} Y$, with
$$
\begin{gathered}
\mathbb{Z} Y_0 \stackrel{\partial}{\leftarrow} \mathbb{Z} Y_1 \stackrel{\partial}{\leftarrow} \mathbb{Z} Y_2 \leftarrow \ldots \quad \text { and } \\
\partial=\sum_{i=0}^n(-1)^i d_i
\end{gathered}
$$
in degree $n$. Recall that the integral singular homology groups $H_*(X ; \mathbb{Z})$ of the space $X$ are defined to be the homology groups of the chain complex $\mathbb{Z} S X$. The homology groups $H_n(Y, A)$ of a simplicial set $Y$ with coefficients in an abelian group $A$ are defined to be the homology groups $H_n(\mathbb{Z} Y \otimes A)$ of the chain complex $\mathbb{Z} Y \otimes A$.



\subsection*{Geometric realization}

\textbf{The simplex category:} $\Delta \downarrow X$ of a simplicial set $X$. The objects of $\Delta \downarrow X$ are the maps $\sigma: \Delta^n \rightarrow X$, or simplices of $X$. An arrow of $\Delta \downarrow X$ is a commutative diagram of simplicial maps .....

Observe that $\theta$ is induced by a unique ordinal number $\operatorname{map} \theta: \mathbf{m} \rightarrow \mathbf{n}$.
\begin{lemm} There is an isomorphism
$$
\begin{aligned}
& X \cong \underset{\Delta^n \longrightarrow X}{\lim _{\longrightarrow}} \Delta^n . \\
& \text { in } \Delta \downarrow X \\
&
\end{aligned}
$$
\end{lemm}

The realization $|X|$ of a simplicial set $X$ is defined by the colimit
$$
\begin{aligned}
|X|= & \xrightarrow{\lim }\left|\Delta^n\right| . \\
& \Delta^n \rightarrow X \\
& \text { in } \Delta \downarrow X
\end{aligned}
$$
in the category of topological spaces. The construction $X \mapsto|X|$ is seen to be functorial in simplicial sets $X$, by using the fact that any simplicial map $f: X \rightarrow Y$ induces a functor $f_*: \Delta \downarrow X \rightarrow \Delta \downarrow Y$ by composition with $f$.

\begin{prop}
    The realization functor is left adjoint to the singular functor in the sense that there is an isomorphism
$$
\operatorname{hom}_{\text {Top }}(|X|, Y) \cong \operatorname{hom}_{\mathbf{S}}(X, S Y)
$$
which is natural in simplicial sets $X$ and topological spaces $Y$. In particular, since $\mathbf{S}$ has all colimits and the realization functor, || preserves them.
\end{prop} 

\begin{prop}
    $|X|$ is a $C W$-complex for each simplicial set $X$. In particular it is a compactly generated Hausdorff space.
\end{prop}

\section{Semi-simplicial sets}

It will suffice for our purposes to keep track of less structure, and replace $\Delta$ by its subcategory $\Delta_{\text {inj }}$ with the same objects but morphisms only injective order-preserving maps. A semi-simplicial set is a functor $\Delta_{\mathrm{inj}}^{\mathrm{op}} \rightarrow$ Set and a semi-simplicial space is a functor $\Delta_{\mathrm{inj}}^{\mathrm{op}} \rightarrow$ Top. That, it is the analogue of a simplicial space which only face maps and no degeneracy maps. We can restrict $\Delta^{\bullet}$ to $\Delta_{\text {inj }}$ and once more take the coend to get a geometric realisation
$$
\left\|X_{\bullet}\right\|:=\Delta^{\bullet} \otimes_{\Delta_{\text {inj }}} X_{\bullet}=\left(\bigsqcup_{p \geq 0} \Delta^p \times X_p\right) / \sim
$$
with $\sim$ the equivalence relation generated by $\left(\delta_i t, x\right) \sim\left(t, d_i x\right)$. A reference for semisimplicial spaces and their properties is [ERW19].

We now define the semi-simpicial set with $\Sigma_n$-action which will replace $*$. Let FI be the category whose objects are finite sets and whose morphisms are injections.

$W_n(1) \bullet$ is the \textbf{semi-simplicial set with $p$-simplices} given by
$$
W_n(\underline{1}) \bullet=\operatorname{Hom}_{\mathrm{FI}}([p], \underline{n})
$$
and face maps $d_i$ given by precomposition with $\delta_i:[p-1] \rightarrow[p]$.
That is, $W_n(1)_p$ has as $p$-simplices the ordered words $\left(m_0 m_1 \cdots m_p\right)$ of elements of $\underline{n}$ and no letter duplicated. The $i$ th face map forgets the $i$ th letter $m_i$. This explains why we call this the semi-simplicial set of injective words. The notation is rather complicated, but will become clear in the next lecture.

The group $\Sigma_n$ acts on $W_n(1)$. by post-composition, and hence on the geometric realisation. We have that:

\begin{prop}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $\left\|W_n(\mathbf{1}) \cdot\right\|$ is homologically $\frac{n-1}{2}$-connected.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{prop}
(ii) $W_n(\underline{1})_p$ is a transitive $\Sigma_n$-set, and the stabiliser of $x \in W_n(1)_p$ is the group of permutations of $\underline{n} \backslash \operatorname{im}(x)$.

A filtration $F_0 X \subset F_1 X \subset \ldots$ on a space $X$ makes the singular chains $C_*(X)$ into a filtered chain complex by setting $F_r C_*(X):=\operatorname{im}\left(C_*\left(F_r X\right) \rightarrow C_*(X)\right)$. Assuming that $F_{r-1} X \rightarrow F_r X$ is a cofibration and $F_r X / F_{r-1} X$ is at least $(r-1)$-connected, this gives a strongly-convergent first-quadrant spectral sequence
$$
E_{p, q}^1=\widetilde{H}_{p+q}\left(F_p X / F_{p-1} X ; \mathbb{Z}\right) \Longrightarrow H_{p+q}(X ; \mathbb{Z})
$$
with differentials given by $d^r: E_{p, q}^r \rightarrow E_{p-r, q+r-1}^r$.
Remark 2.3.1. If you are unfamiliar with these notions, I recommend you look at [McC01, Hat]. Roughly, a spectral sequence is an algebraic object that conveniently packages all long exact sequences in homology for the pairs $\left(F_s X, F_r X\right)$ with $s \geq r$ with the goal of compute the homology of $X$.
We can in particular apply this to the geometric realisation $\left\|X_{\bullet}\right\|$. This has a filtration
$$
F_r\left\|X_{\bullet}\right\|:=\left(\bigsqcup_{0 \leq p \leq r} \Delta^p \times X_p\right) / \sim
$$
with equivalence relation $\sim$ as before, all of whose maps are cofibrations under a mild condition on $X_{\bullet}$ that will be satisfied in examples in these notes. The associated graded is given by
$$
\frac{F_r\left\|X_{\bullet}\right\|}{F_{r-1}\left\|X_{\bullet}\right\|}=\frac{\Delta^r}{\partial \Delta^r} \wedge\left(X_r\right)_{+}
$$
so is at least $(r-1)$-connected. Thus we get [Seg68] (see also [ERW19, Section 1.4]):

\begin{theo}
    There is a strongly convergent first quadrant spectral sequence
    $$
    E_{p, q}^1=H_q\left(X_p ; \mathbb{Z}\right) \Longrightarrow H_{p+q}\left(\left\|X_{\bullet}\right\| ; \mathbb{Z}\right)
    $$
    with differentials given by $d^r: E_{p, q}^r \rightarrow E_{p-r, q+r-1}^r$. Moreover $d^1: E_{p, q}^1 \rightarrow E_{p-1, q}^1$ is given by $\sum_{i=0}^p(-1)^i\left(d_i\right)_*$, and the edge homomorphism $E_{0, q}^1 \rightarrow E_{0, q}^{\infty} \rightarrow H_q(X ; \mathbb{Z})$ is equal to the map induced on homology by the inclusion $X_0 \rightarrow\left\|X_{\bullet}\right\|$.   
\end{theo}







\chapter{Geometric Group Theory}

By a \textbf{$G$-complex} we will mean a $C W$-complex $X$ together with an action of $G$ on $X$ which permutes the cells. Thus we have for each $g \in G$ a homeomorphism $x \mapsto g x$ of $X$ such that the image go of any cell $\sigma$ of $X$ is again a cell. For example, if $X$ is a simplicial complex on which $G$ acts simplicially, then $X$ is a $G$-complex.

If $X$ is a $G$-complex then the action of $G$ on $X$ induces an action of $G$ on the cellular chain complex $C_*(X)$, which thereby becomes a chain complex of $G$-modules. Moreover, the canonical augmentation $\varepsilon: C_0(X) \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}$ (defined by $\varepsilon(v)=1$ for every 0 -cell $v$ of $X$ ) is a map of $G$-modules.

We will say that $X$ is a free $G$-complex if the action of $G$ freely permutes the cells of $X$ (i.e., $g \sigma \neq \sigma$ for all $\sigma$ if $g \neq 1$ ). In this case each chain module $C_n(X)$ has a $\mathbb{Z}$-basis which is freely permuted by $G$, hence by $3.1 C_n(X)$ is a free $\mathbb{Z} G$-module with one basis element for every $G$-orbit of cells. (Note that to obtain a specific basis we must choose a representative cell from each orbit and we must choose an orientation of each such representative.)

Finally, if $X$ is contractible, then $H_*(X) \approx H_*$ (pt.); in other words, the sequence
$$
\cdots \rightarrow C_n(X) \stackrel{\partial}{\rightarrow} C_{n-1}(X) \rightarrow \cdots \rightarrow C_0(X) \stackrel{\varepsilon}{\rightarrow} \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow 0
$$
is exact. We have, therefore:

\begin{prop}
    
    Let $X$ be a contractible free $G$-complex. Then the augmented cellular chain complex of $X$ is a free resolution of $\mathbb{Z}$ over $\mathbb{Z} G$.
\end{prop}




\section{Classifying space}

Suppose that $\mathcal{C}$ is a (small) category. The classifying space (or nerve ) $B \mathcal{C}$ of $\mathcal{C}$ is the simplicial set with
$$
B \mathcal{C}_n=\operatorname{hom}_{\text {cat }}(\mathbf{n}, \mathcal{C}),
$$
$n$-simplex is a string
$$
a_0 \xrightarrow{\alpha_1} a_1 \xrightarrow{\alpha_2} \ldots \xrightarrow{\alpha_n} a_n
$$
of composeable arrows of length $n$ in $\mathcal{C}$.\\

If $G$ is a group, then $G$ can be identified with a category (or groupoid) with one object $*$ and one morphism $g: * \rightarrow *$ for each element $g$ of $G$, and so the classifying space $B G$ of $G$ is defined. Moreover $|B G|$ is an Eilenberg-Mac Lane space of the form $K(G, 1)$, as the notation suggests; this is now the standard construction.


Recall that we constructed $B G$ as the geometric realisation of the nerve of a category * // $G$. As the notation suggests, this can be interpreted as a quotient, or more precisely a homotopy quotient. One can construct the homotopy quotient $X / / G$ of any space $X$ with $G$-action by a group $G$, and here we just take $X=*$. By abuse of notation * // $G=|N(* / / G)|{ }^2$ A reference for its construction and properties is [Rie14], but we will only need the following facts:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Homotopy quotients are natural. If $X \rightarrow Y$ is an equivariant map between $G$-spaces then there is an induced map $X / / G \rightarrow Y / / G$.
    \item Homotopy quotients preserve homological connectivity. If $X \rightarrow Y$ is an equivariant map between $G$-spaces which is homologically $d$-connected then $X / / G \rightarrow Y / / G$ is also homologically $d$-connected. (Recall that a map is homologically $d$-connected if it is an isomorphism on $H_i$ for $i<d$ and surjection on $H_d$.)
    \item Homotopy quotients commute with geometric realisation. If $X_{\bullet}$ is a semi-simplicial $G$-space, then $\left\|X_{\bullet}\right\| / / G \simeq\left\|X_{\bullet} / / G\right\|$. (We will explain the terminology and notation later.)
    \item Homotopy quotients of transitive $G$-sets. If $S$ is a transitive $G$-set, then $S / / G \simeq$ $B \operatorname{Stab}_G(s)$ for any $s \in S$.
\end{enumerate}









\chapter{Homotopy theory}

Let $I^n$ be the $n$-dimensional unit cube, the product of $n$ copies of the interval $[0,1]$. The boundary $\partial I^n$ of $I^n$ is the subspace consisting of points with at least one coordinate equal to 0 or 1 . For a space $X$ with basepoint $x_0 \in X$, define $\pi_n\left(X, x_0\right)$ to be the set of homotopy classes of maps $f:\left(I^n, \partial I^n\right) \rightarrow\left(X, x_0\right)$, where homotopies $f_t$ are required to satisfy $f_t\left(\partial I^n\right)=x_0$ for all $t$. The definition extends to the case $n=0$ by taking $I^0$ to be a point and $\partial I^0$ to be empty, so $\pi_0\left(X, x_0\right)$ is just the set of path-components of $X$.

When $n \geq 2$, a sum operation in $\pi_n\left(X, x_0\right)$, generalizing the composition operation in $\pi_1$, is defined by
$$
(f+g)\left(s_1, s_2, \cdots, s_n\right)= \begin{cases}f\left(2 s_1, s_2, \cdots, s_n\right), & s_1 \in[0,1 / 2] \\ g\left(2 s_1-1, s_2, \cdots, s_n\right), & s_1 \in[1 / 2,1]\end{cases}
$$

It is evident that this sum is well-defined on homotopy classes. Since only the first coordinate is involved in the sum operation, the same arguments as for $\pi_1$ show that $\pi_n\left(X, x_0\right)$ is a group, with identity element the constant map sending $I^n$ to $x_0$ and with inverses given by $-f\left(s_1, s_2, \cdots, s_n\right)=f\left(1-s_1, s_2, \cdots, s_n\right)$.


\begin{prop}
    If $n \geq 2$, then $\pi_n\left(X, x_0\right)$ is abelian.
\end{prop}


\section{Covering spaces}
%estamos solo usando estos resultados... deberiamos dar mejores definiciones


In view of 4.1, it is natural now to consider $C W$-complexes $Y$ satisfying the following three conditions:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $Y$ is connected.
    \item $\pi_1(Y)$ is isomorphic to $G$.
    \item The universal covering space $X$ of $Y$ is contractible.
\end{enumerate}



\section{Eilenberg-Mac Lane spaces}

The $n$th singular cohomology group of a space $X$ with coefficients in an abelian group $A$ is isomorphic to the homotopy classes of maps from $X$ to an Eilenberg-Mac Lane space, denoted by $K(A, n)$ of the homotopy type of a CW space, such that
$$
\pi_i K(A, n)= \begin{cases}A, & \text { if } i=n \\ 0, & \text { otherwise }\end{cases}
$$

The $K(A, n)$ are infinite loop spaces, and hence, the set of homotopy classes of maps $[X, K(A, n)]$ is actually an abelian group for all $n \geq 0$ and
$$
H^n(X ; A) \cong[X, K(A, n)]
$$
is an isomorphism of abelian groups that is natural in the space $X$. Thus the functor $X \mapsto$ $H^n(X ; A)$ is representable. A cohomology operation $\varphi_{(A, n),(B, m)}: H^n(X ; A) \rightarrow H^m(X ; B)$, which is natural in $X$, can hence be identified with a natural transformation between the functors $X \mapsto[X, K(A, n)]$ and $X \mapsto[X, K(B, m)]$, and these in turn are in bijection with $[K(A, n), K(B, m)] \cong H^m(K(A, n) ; B)$. Here, we actually get an isomorphism of abelian groups!! As $K(A, n)$ doesn't have nontrivial cohomology groups below degree $n$ (due to the Hurewicz theorem), these operations are trivial for $m<n$. For $A=B=\mathbb{F}_p$, a prime field, the collection of all such cohomology operations constitutes the Steenrod algebra.

More generally, Brown's representability theorem states that every generalized cohomology theory can be represented by an Omega spectrum ([Ad74], [Sw75, chapter 9]).
